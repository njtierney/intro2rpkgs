# About this {-}

This book is an **introduction to** creating an R package. It focusses on building an R package with 1-2 functions, the `praiseme` package (modelled on the [praise](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/praise/) package). 

This book is a resource that will grow and change over time as a **living book**.

After reading this book and doing the workshop, you should feel comfortable doing the following:

- Create the basic structure of an R package.
- Manage dependencies with [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) and [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/).
- Create documentation with [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/).
- Write and run unit tests with [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) to verify package functionality.
- Use Git and GitHub to put your R package online.
- Understand next steps for advanced package development, including:
	- Automatically run tests with continuous integration via GitHub Actions.
	- Create professional package websites using [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/).
	- Make your R package easily installable with the [R Universe](https://r-universe.dev/search).
