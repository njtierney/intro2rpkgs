### Introduction to R packages

Do you have R code you want to share? You can transform your R code into a shareable tool by developing it into an R package. This course bridges the gap between writing isolated R functions and creating documented packages that can be easily distributed, and is designed for those who might be curious about R package development but haven't had the time or guidance to get started.

You'll learn the essential tools of the trade: `usethis` and `devtools` for package structure, `roxygen2` for documentation, `testthat` for testing, and Git/GitHub for sharing your work.

Whether you're looking to organise your personal code collection or contribute to the broader R ecosystem, this course provides the foundation you need.
